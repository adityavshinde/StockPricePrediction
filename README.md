## **Features**

- **LSTM Neural Network Architecture**  
  Designed and implemented an LSTM model to capture temporal patterns and predict stock price trends.  

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Cleaned and preprocessed financial datasets to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.  
  - Scaled data using MinMaxScaler to enhance model performance.  

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**  
  - Tuned key parameters, including activation functions, number of neurons, learning rate, and model depth, to improve accuracy.  

- **Visualization**  
  - Provided clear visualizations of historical stock prices, training progress, and predicted vs. actual prices.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  

---

## **Dataset**

- The dataset used for training consists of historical stock prices, including open, close, high, low, and volume data.  
- Data preprocessing steps ensure the removal of noise and normalization for consistent input to the model.
